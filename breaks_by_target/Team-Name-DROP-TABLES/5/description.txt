This test finds what happens when a user attempts to delete delegations given to him by the admin.
According to "maintaining the security state" in the spec, this action should do nothing.
Since the admin didn't delete the delegation, it should still exist.
However, Team Name DROP TABLES could not execute the command (FAILED) when it should be able to. This is a correctness violation.
