This is a security failure because the target system allows some keywords for identifiers. According to the break-it spec, a security violation can be found as follows...

'the oracle issues status DENIED but the target doesn't (integrity or privacy security violation)'

Clearly shown by the testcase, the oracle say's denied because the change password failed (same program used keyword as identifier, thus password never changed). 
The target does not say denied because the change password succeeded (didn't check for keyword as identifier, thus succeeded in password change).
