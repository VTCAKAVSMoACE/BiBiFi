This test finds what happens when a user attempts to delete a delegation both they and the admin had given to another principal.
According to "maintaining the security state" in the spec, this action should be valid, but the other principal should still have a valid permission delegation from the admin.
Since the admin didn't delete the 'delegate' permission, it should still exist.
However, Team Name Drop TABLES is unable to complete the action (FAILED) when it should be able to.
This is a correctness violation.
