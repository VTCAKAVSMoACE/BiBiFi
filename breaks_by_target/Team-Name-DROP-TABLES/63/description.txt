This is a security failure because the target system allows no whitespace between keywords for password changes. According to the break-it spec, a security violation can be found as follows...

'the oracle issues status DENIED but the target doesn't (integrity or privacy security violation)'

Clearly shown by the testcase, the oracle say's denied because the change password failed (didn't have whitespace). 
The target does not say denied because the change password succeeded (didn't check for whitespace).
