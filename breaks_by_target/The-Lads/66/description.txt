This is a security failure because the target system allows whitespace between brackets for a new list. According to the break-it spec, a security violation can be found as follows...

'the oracle issues status DENIED but the target doesn't (integrity or privacy security violation)'

Clearly shown by the testcase, the oracle say's denied because the change password failed (caught whitespace between brakcets, thus password never changed). 
The target does not say denied because the change password succeeded (didn't check for whitespace between brackets, thus succeeded in password change).
