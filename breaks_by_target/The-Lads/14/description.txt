This test explores the capabilities of the principal 'anyone' by trying to login, change his password, and make a variable.
This test also uses the logic of default delegator by creating a principal and attempting to access a variable.
Since 'anyone' should be a pre-configured principal according to the spec, the admin should be able to change his password.
However, The Lads is unable to change the password of 'anyone' (FAILED) when it should be able to.
This occurs when trying to set the password of 'anyone'. Also, there is a false security violation when trying to access 'anyone' initially; however, this output is ambiguous.
This is a correctness violation.
