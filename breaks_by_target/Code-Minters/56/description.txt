This is a security failure because the target system allows longer than 255 identifiers. According to the break-it spec, a security violation can be found as follows...

'the oracle issues status DENIED but the target doesn't (integrity or privacy security violation)'

Clearly shown by the testcase, the oracle say's denied because the change password failed (password was never updated, failed when saw long identifier). 
The target does not say denied because the change password succeeded (didn't fail on long identifier).
