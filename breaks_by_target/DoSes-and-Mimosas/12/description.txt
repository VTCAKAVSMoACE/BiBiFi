This test explores the capabilities of the principal 'anyone' by trying to login, change his password, and make a variable.
This test also uses the logic of default delegator by creating a principal and attempting to access a variable.
Since 'anyone' should be a pre-configured principal according to the spec, the admin should be able to change his password.
However, DoSes and Mimosas flagged a security violation (DENIED) when it shouldn't.
This occurs when trying to set the password of 'anyone'. Also, there is a false security violation when trying to access 'anyone' initially; however, this output is ambiguous.
This is a availability security violation.
