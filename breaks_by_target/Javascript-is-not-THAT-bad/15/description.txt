This test explores the capabilities of the principal 'anyone' by trying to login, change his password, and make a variable.
This test also uses the logic of default delegator by creating a principal and attempting to access a variable.
Since 'anyone' should be a pre-configured principal according to the spec, 'anyone' should be able to login once his password has been changed by the admin.
However, Javascript is not THAT bad returns nothing when it should return something.
This occurs when trying to login as 'anyone'. Also, there is a false security violation when trying to access 'anyone' initially; however, this output is ambiguous.
This is a correctness violation.
