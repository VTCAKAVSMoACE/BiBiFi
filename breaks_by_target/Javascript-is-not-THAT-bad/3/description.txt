This test finds what happens when a user attempts to delete a delegation both they and the admin had given to another principal.
According to "maintaining the security state" in the spec, this action should be valid, but the other principal should still have a valid permission delegation from the admin.
Since the admin didn't delete the 'delegate' permission, it should still exist.
However, Javascript is not THAT bad does not output anything for the last program (it didn't return within 30 seconds).
After adjusting delegation rules, a principal, who has delegation permission from the admin, attempts to set a permission on another principal.
This is a availability security violation.
