This test creates a principal with a password that is only spaces. This should work, since the spec specifies in the grammar that passwords are strings, 
and string match the regex [A-Za-z0-9_ ,;\.?!-]*. JavaScript-is-not-THAT-bad failed this test because while the oracle was able to complete all programs and returns "hello world" for the second program, 
Javascripts' server does not return anything for the second program.
This is a correctness violation.
