Break fixed: 37.
Bug: able to set delegation to local variables
Issue: not checking if the variable is local or not when setting the delegation
Fix: we modified our code to check if the variable is present in the set of global variables we have so that we avoid setting delegations for local variables in build/database/src/lib.rs at line 142
