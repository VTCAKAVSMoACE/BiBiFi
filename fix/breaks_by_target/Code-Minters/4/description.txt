This test finds what happens when a user attempts to delete delegations given to him by the admin.
According to "maintaining the security state" in the spec, this action should do nothing.
Since the admin didn't delete the delegation, it should still exist.
However, Code Minters flagged the command as a security violation (DENIED) when it should not be. This is a availability security violation.
