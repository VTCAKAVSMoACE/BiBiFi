This is a security failure because the target system does not allow delegation of rights to predefined principal anyone. According to the break-it spec, a security violation can be found as follows...

'the oracle issues status DENIED but the target doesn't (integrity or privacy security violation)'

The testcase shows that target say's failed to the first program because they fail to include principal anyone in their list of principals. therefore the delegation fails and triggers
a chain of fails in all programs. The oracle does not say failed, but rather 'denied' because none of the programs had an error and read rights were
succesfully deleted for anyone in the second to last program therefore no one but admin should be allowed to read the contents of x.
