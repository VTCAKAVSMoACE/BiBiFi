This test creates a principal with a password that is only spaces. This should work, since the spec specifies in the grammar that passwords are strings, 
and string match the regex [A-Za-z0-9_ ,;\.?!-]*. The Code-Minters failed this test because although the oracle returned an output within a few seconds, the Code-Minters' 
server hangs for at least a minute. This is an availability security violation.
