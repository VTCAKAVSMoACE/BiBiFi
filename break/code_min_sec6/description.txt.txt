According to the "set delegation" section in the spec, a non-admin principal can only set the delegation if they have delegate permission over the variable.

But in the test case where bob does not have delegate permission over "x" tries to delegate permissions, the server runs successfully instead of returning "DENIED". This is hence a security violation according to the break it spec.
